# Permission Handler

This permission handler app demonstrate how to request a runtime permission in android for single and
multiple permissions also handling the denial situation gracefully.

- I show both ways by using ```registerForActivityResult``` for handling request code by the android system.
- And i also showed ```onRequestPermissionsResult``` to handle the request code by ourselves for permissions.
